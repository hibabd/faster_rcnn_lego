# Faster R-CNN as an Application for Object Detection of Scattered LEGO Pieces

A few notes about the code:
- When a file is named faster_rcnn_x, x refers to the type of dataset it should run on (i.e. synthetic-50 blocks, synthetic, cut&paste or real)
- Running the code takes a large CPU/GPU capacity, so I included the sbatch code that I used to queue jobs on the server
